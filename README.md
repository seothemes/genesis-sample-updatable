# Genesis Sample Theme with Automatic Updates

Proof of concept for allowing automatic updates in the Genesis Sample theme without losing customizations.


## Installation Instructions

1. Upload the Genesis Sample theme folder via FTP to your wp-content/themes/ directory. (The Genesis parent theme needs to be in the wp-content/themes/ directory as well.)
2. Go to your WordPress dashboard and select Appearance.
3. Activate the Genesis Sample theme.
4. Inside your WordPress dashboard, go to Appearance > Theme Editor and change the style.css version to 1.0.0.
5. Add a custom code snippet to the style.css file and/or the functions.php file.
6. Navigate to Appearance > Themes, there should now be an update notice showing.
7. Click update and once it has finished running, refresh the page.
8. There should now be 3 themes - Genesis, Genesis Sample and Genesis Sample 1.0.0 Backup.
9. Navigate to Appearance > Theme Editor and select the new Genesis Sample theme.
10. Check that your custom code snippets were carried over to the new version.
